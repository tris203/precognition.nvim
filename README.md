    -- highlightColor = { link = "Comment" },
    -- hints = {
    --      Caret = { text = "^", prio = 2 },
    --      Dollar = { text = "$", prio = 1 },
    --      MatchingPair = { text = "%", prio = 5 },
    --      Zero = { text = "0", prio = 1 },
    --      w = { text = "w", prio = 10 },
    --      b = { text = "b", prio = 9 },

    --      E = { text = "E", prio = 5 },
    -- },
    -- gutterHints = {
    --     -- prio is not currently used for gutter hints
    --     G = { text = "G", prio = 1 },
    --     gg = { text = "gg", prio = 1 },
    --     PrevParagraph = { text = "{", prio = 1 },

    -- },
    },
}

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

- Items can be hidden by settings their priority to 0, if you want to hide the
  entire virtual line. Set all elements to `prio = 0` in combination with the
  below.
- `showBlankVirtLine = false`
  Setting this option will mean that if a Virtual Line would be blank it wont be
  rendered
- highlightColor can be set in two ways:

1. As a table containing a link property pointing to an existing highlight group (see `:highlight` for valid options).
2. As a table specifying custom highlight values, such as foreground and background colors. ([more info](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_set_hl()>))

## ‚ùîUsage

### Toggling

The hints can be toggled on and off with

```
:lua require("precognition").toggle()
```

### Peeking

The hints can be peeked, this means that the hint will be show until the next
cursor movement.

```
:lua require("precognition").peek()
```
