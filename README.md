Installation with any package manager, Lazy example below:

```lua

return {
    "tris203/precognition.nvim",
    --event = "VeryLazy",
    config = {
    -- startVisible = true,
    -- showBlankVirtLine = true,
    -- highlightColor = { link = "Comment" },
    -- hints = {
    --      Caret = { text = "^", prio = 2 },
    --      Dollar = { text = "$", prio = 1 },
    --      MatchingPair = { text = "%", prio = 5 },
    --      Zero = { text = "0", prio = 1 },
    --      w = { text = "w", prio = 10 },
    --      b = { text = "b", prio = 9 },
    --      e = { text = "e", prio = 8 },
    --      W = { text = "W", prio = 7 },
    --      B = { text = "B", prio = 6 },
    --      E = { text = "E", prio = 5 },
    -- },
    -- gutterHints = {
    --     G = { text = "G", prio = 10 },
    --     gg = { text = "gg", prio = 9 },
    --     PrevParagraph = { text = "{", prio = 8 },
    --     NextParagraph = { text = "}", prio = 8 },
    -- },
    },
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

- `hints` can be hidden by setting their priority to 0. If you want to hide the
  entire virtual line, set all elements to `prio = 0` in combination with the
  below.
- `showBlankVirtLine = false`
  Setting this option will mean that if a Virtual Line would be blank it won't be
  rendered
- `gutterHints` can be hidden by setting their priority to 0.
- `highlightColor` can be set in two ways:

    1. As a table containing a link property pointing to an existing highlight group (see `:highlight` for valid options).
    2. As a table specifying custom highlight values, such as foreground and background colors. ([more info](<https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_set_hl()>))

### Hint priorities

Any hints that could appear in the same place as others should have unique priorities to avoid conflicts.

## ‚ùîUsage

### Toggling

The hints can be toggled on and off with

```
:lua require("precognition").toggle()
```

### Peeking

The hints can be peeked, this means that the hint will be show until the next
cursor movement.

```
:lua require("precognition").peek()
```
